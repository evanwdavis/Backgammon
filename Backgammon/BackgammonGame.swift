     Alright so the game object can keep track of the board, pieces, players... 
     iMessage glue should probably point to game, handle player (white, black)
     
     
     Game
        - handle dice rolls, turns, valid moves, references to Player objects
     Player objects
        - 
     
     
     or 
     
     Game

     UI notes from connect 4 
        - it's easy not to know which move your opponent made last, this should be obvious in the UI. 
        - with dice rolls, might be nice to animate the moves (but probably not a v1 feature
     
        - UI will need some treatment for "focus" of a particular space, after a user taps it to contemplate their moves. when they tap a space / piece, their available moves are then highlighted for them (if available)
        - alright I'm taking this to a notepad to sketch out a bit.
