# Backgammon 

My attempt to build a swifty backgammon game. First game, and first app written totally in swift! Obviously a work in progress... so let's go with some steps

1. Roll Dice functionality
* should be pretty easy
2. very basic UI 
* gotta be able to manipulate the game on some level. Basically I want to build a board and pieces and have them manipulatable (if that's a word) 
3. game logic 
* the meat of the app, what drives the game. players, pieces, turns, valid moves, etc. 
4. a better UI 
* have it look nice, and respond to game rules. Only move valid pieces, etc. Nothing flashy, but it should look clean and work wel. 
5. Polish! we have a simple one-phone game! 
6. Multiplayer! This could be gamecenter or iMessage, or something else? Obviously there's a lot to this
